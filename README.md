<b>MySQL Employee Tracker:</b>
<hr>

Business owners need to be able to manage the staff in their company so that they can organize and plan their business. This application will do just that by allowing them to view or add new deparments, roles, and employees. It will also allow them to update the roles of current employees. This functionality is made possible by utilizing the MySQL and Inquirer NPM packages.
